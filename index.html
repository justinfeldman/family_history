He was forced to conduct these economic transactions with Christians under the cover of darkness, as any such exchange had become a serious liability. He sold all of their furniture, including an antique cupboard with a secret compartment. He also sent his torah and torah ark to a relative living elsewhere in Germany. Nearing the end of their time in the country, Anschel sold the Baum family farmhouse to a Christian man named Andreas Gossman, whose descendants still live in the house today. All of these sales were made at extortionate prices, as Christians knowingly took advantage of the economic pressure imposed on the Jewish community. Anschel and Lina boarded a ship bound for the US on June 21, 1934, reportedly carrying \"7,000\", likely reported in Marks, which would be equivalent to about $65,000 USD today. Upon arriving, they settled within ten blocks of their daughter Frieda, who lived at 427 St. Johns Place in Brooklyn."

The exact nature of the misdemeanor remains unclear; it could have dated back to his youth in Kassel or been a bureaucratic issue related to his business dealings.

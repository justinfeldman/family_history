Nearing the end of their time in the country, Anschel sold the Baum family farmhouse to a Christian man named Andreas Gossman, whose descendants still live in the house today. All of these sales were made at extortionate prices, as Christians knowingly took advantage of the economic pressure imposed on the Jewish community. Anschel and Lina boarded a ship bound for the US on June 21, 1934, reportedly carrying \"7,000\", likely reported in Marks, which would be equivalent to about $65,000 USD today.

The police interviewed a father and son from the neighboring Peil family, who insisted no one ever bore ill will toward Anschel, that his home and possessions were of low value, and that the sales were not forced (even while acknowledging that all of the sales took place under the cover of darkness).
